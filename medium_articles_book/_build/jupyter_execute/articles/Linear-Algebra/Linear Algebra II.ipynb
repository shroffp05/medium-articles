    "## Part 1: Solving a linear system\n",
    "\n",
    "In school you were taught how to solve two equations with two unknowns using elimination and substitution. For example, lets say we have two equations:\n",
    "$4x + 2y = 14$\n",
    "\n",
    "$3x - 5y = -22$\n",
    "\n",
    "We could solve these linear equations by elimination and subsititution to find $x = 1$ and $y = 5$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rewrite these equations in the form of a matrix:\n",
    "$\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "    4 & 2 \\\\ \n",
    "    3 & -5\n",
    " \\end{pmatrix}$$\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}$ = $\\begin{pmatrix} 14 \\\\ -22 \\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    " \n",
    "In reality we would rarely encouter a 2x2 matrix. More often than not, the matrices would be much bigger and trying to solve them using elimination and subsitution would get very complex very quickly. Converting them to matrices and then solving it makes it much easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can rewrite any system of linear equations like this: $AX = B$, where A is our $nxn$ matrix of coefficients (**Note the matrix does not have to be a square matrix {rows=columns}, but for this tutorial we will assume square matrices**), X is our $nx1$ vector of variables and B is our $nx1$ vector of output.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how would you solve the above system equations when written in matrix form? \n",
    "\n",
    "First thing I want to introduce is this concept called <i><b>Augmented Matrix</b></i>. Augmented matrix is just a notational concept, where we rewrite the matrix equation ($AX = B$) in a way where its easy to solve. In augmented matrix terms, the above equations would be written like this:\n",
    "$\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "    4 & 2 & | & 14 \\\\\n",
    "    3 & -5 & | & -22\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to solve this system, we can use row operations to find the solution. I am not going to go over row operations, since the focus of this article is on solving systems of equations using numpy; however, if you want to read up about row operations and RROE form (Reduced Row Echelon Forms) you can do so [here](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Algebra/Intermediate_Algebra_(OpenStax)/04%3A_Systems_of_Linear_Equations/4.06%3A_Solve_Systems_of_Equations_Using_Matrices).\n",

    "           \n",
    "The determinant of A, denoted as $det(A)$, for a 2x2 matrix is calculated by multiplying the diagonal enteries of the matrix and subtracting them. \n",

Now draw vertical and horizontal line segments through 1 and the matrix that remains is $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 5 \\\\ 9&9 \\end{pmatrix}$. Now we find the determinant of this matrix, which we know how to from the previous section. So the determinant of this matrix is $18-45 = -27$. And finally multiply this by 1, which was the first value in the row we selected. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now follow the same steps with 6 and then 3. What we get is an equation like this:\n",
    "$det(A) = 1*det(\\begin{pmatrix} 2&5 \\\\ 9&9 \\end{pmatrix}) - 6*det(\\begin{pmatrix} 3&5 \\\\ 8&9 \\end{pmatrix}) + 3*det(\\begin{pmatrix} 3&2 \\\\ 8&9 \\end{pmatrix})$\n",

    "The word <i>\"eigen\"</i> comes from the german word, meaning own. In linear algebra, an eigenvector $v$ of a linear transformation $T$, is a non-zero vector that doesnt change direction after the T linear transformation has been applied to it. It only changes magnitude by the factor of its eigenvalue <sup>3</sup>. \n",
    "\n",
    "What that means is, when a linear transformation, such as stretching, rotating etc, is applied to the vector, it does not change is original direction, just the magnitude by a factor of its eigenvalue. \n",

    "> $Av = \\lambda v$\n",
    "\n",

    "As you can see the vector $u$ did not change its original direction after the linear transformation was applied, it was merely scaled. The scaling factor is its eigenvalue. However, the vector $v$ did change its direction and magintude. So we can say, for the matrix $A$, there exists an eigenvector $u$. \n",
